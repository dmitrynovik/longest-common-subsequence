[Wikipedia article on LCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)


### Problem Example
Given two input strings, "ABCBDAB" and "BDCABA", the LCS is "BCBA".

### Complexity
Using dynamic programming (memoization);

Time: O(_mn_), where _m_ and _n_ are the respective input string length
Space: O(_mn_)
